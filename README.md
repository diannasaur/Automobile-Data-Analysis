# Automobile-Data-Analysis
For my Fundamentals of Data Science class, my team and I created a google site displaying our research about a large dataset. We explored which characteristics of vehicles result in the lowest insurance risk. After exploring all the variables and creating various linear regression and CART models, we found three variables that are the most important in contributing to the insurance risk rating of a car.

Here is the link to our site:
